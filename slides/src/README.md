# Introduction

This collection of materials was collected and written for a two day university workshop with (more or less) absolute beginners in mind.

The goal is to convery the very foundations of (DIY) electronics and how they relate to physical computing as an artistic tool and skill.

That being said, there is only so much one can cover in two days. So this is far from a comprehensive guide but, as the title suggests, an introduction to the field.

Big thanks to Stefan Püst for the original workshop and materials!

## Build

Created using `mdbook` and `mdbook-mermaid`. To build it yourself run (assuming [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed)

``` shell
$ cargo install mdbook mdbook-mermaid
$ mdbook build
```
Then serve the output statically.
