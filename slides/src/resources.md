## Shops

Shops I've bought from in the past:

- https://www.berrybase.de/
- https://www.roboter-bausatz.de/
- https://www.makershop.de/
- https://www.pollin.de/
- https://tweakable-parts.com/en/

Also just ebay and alibaba if you have the time to wait for shipment from China.

It's also always worth to ask a nerd friend for unused stuff!
