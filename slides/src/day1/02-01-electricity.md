# Electricity

## Electrical charge

|Symbol|Unit|
|--|--|
|Q| Coulomb (C) or Ampere Second (As)|

- Physical property on which all electricity is based

- Bound to matter, needs a charge carrier (e.g. electrons)

- Positive, negative, neutral charge

- Different charges attract, similiar charges retract


## Electrical current

|Symbol|Unit|
|--|--|
|I| Ampere (A)|

- Result of moving charge carriers

- The more charged particles move between conductors, the more current flows


## Electrical voltage

|Symbol|Unit|
|--|--|
|U| Volt (V)|

- Causes the movement of charge carriers

- Difference of potential

## Electrical resistance

|Symbol|Unit|
|--|--|
|R| Ohm (Î©)|

- Caused by obstruction of charge carriers in conductors

- Converts electrical energy into heat

## Electrical power

|Symbol|Unit|
|--|--|
|P| Watt (W)|

- Amount of energy per time unit t

- W = I x U

## Measuring

We measure **current** flowing through **one point**.

We meassure **voltage** between **two points**.
