# Computers

- Brain of Physical Computing project

- Comes in different sizes

- Converts input to outputs

- Must be programmed

- Digital device

## Microcontrollers

- Very application specific

- Run one programmed

- Usually very cheap

- Low technical specs

- Periphery (RAM, IO) included

- Are in bascially everything

## Microprocessors

- Basically a computer

- Needs periphery (RAM, memory)

- Runs an operating system

## Comparison

![microcontroller vs microprocessor](/assets/micro.png)

## Why these?

- Widespread platforms, lots of ddocumentation

- Inexpensive

- Optimized for hobbyists and learners

- Software-libraries for nearly everything, big open source ecosystem
