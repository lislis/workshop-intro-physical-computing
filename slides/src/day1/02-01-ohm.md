# Ohm's Law

- Describes the relationship between voltage, current and resistance

# Kirchoff's Law

## Current Law

- The sum of all current flowing into and out of a joint is 0

- What goes in goes out (like in a crossing of water pipes)

- Current that flows in has a positive sign, current that flow out has a negative sign

## Voltage Law

- The sum of all voltages in a loop is 0

- Is a consequence of the rule of "conservation of energy" (energy can not be created neither disappear in closed system)

## Consequences

In a **parallel circuit** voltage (U) stays the same, currents need to be summed up

In a **serial circuit** current (I) stays the same, voltages need to be summed up

# Good news

In the beginning, you don't really have to care about these things too much.

It will only become relevant once you start building larger, more complex circuits, and then you can find the formulas and plenty of other resources online.
