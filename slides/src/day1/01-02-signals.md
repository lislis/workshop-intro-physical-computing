# Signals

## Digital vs Analog

- Analog signals are continuous with infinitely smooth transitions

- Digital signals are fixed "steps" with a set resolution

### Conversions

- From an analog signal we sample at given rate and quantise with a given depth.

- From digital to analog we can only approximate through Pulse-Width-Modulation

## Parallel vs Serial

- When we send signals we can send them in parallel or in serial
