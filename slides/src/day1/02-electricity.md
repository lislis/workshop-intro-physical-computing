# Electricity & Circuits

Since we'll get in touch with the physical world, we need to learn about some physical properties of the world, and how they relate to each other.

With this knowledge we can start working on circuits, which I sometimes think of as programming in hardware.

After that we can start reading values from our circuit via a microcontroller.
