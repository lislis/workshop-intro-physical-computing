# [Circuit 2.1] Reading a potentiometer

This is a simple circuit to read an analog value and introduces one of the most common components: the potentiometer aka the poti!

## Poti

Potis are resistors that change their resistance according to their rotatry position. They come in various magnitudes, so depending on your circuit you might buy a 10k Ohm or 1M Ohm poti. Pay attention to whether a poti uses a linear or logarithmic scale for mapping rotatry position to resistance!

## Reading a photoresistor

You can now read all kinds of resistor values! A fader is basically the exact same thing!

A photoresistor for example changes resistance based on the light shining on it. Try making a circuit that lights up an LED when a certain threshold in the resistance is reached. Expand it to a scale of LEDs, the brighter the light the more LEDs light up (See the example in the Arduino IDE for inspiration).
